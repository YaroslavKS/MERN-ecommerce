# MERN-ecommerce
Shopping site UI built with React and Redux (MERN full-stack project)

## Project Description
E-commerce web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with Redux Toolkit for state management.

The project features two main parts:  
- **User Interface (Frontend):** A user-friendly online store with product catalog, shopping cart, user registration, and authentication.  
- **Admin Panel (Backend):** RESTful API to manage products, users, and orders.

This project is aimed to improve my full-stack development skills, deepen understanding of React + Redux, and practice building REST APIs with Express and MongoDB.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Redux Toolkit, Bootstrap  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose  
- **Other:** bcryptjs (password hashing), jsonwebtoken (JWT authentication), dotenv (environment variables), cors

## Hosting and Deployment
- Frontend deployed on **Netlify**  
- Backend deployed on **Render**  
- Database hosted on **MongoDB Atlas**

## Features
- User registration and login with JWT-based authentication  
- Product browsing and shopping cart functionality  
- Admin API for product management (add, edit, delete)  
- Data storage with MongoDB Atlas  
- Responsive UI styled with Bootstrap

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies in both client (`/client`) and server (`/server`) folders with `npm install`  
3. Set up `.env` file with database URI and JWT secret  
4. Run backend server: `npm run server`  
5. Run frontend client: `npm start`  
6. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Project Goals
- Enhance practical skills in the MERN stack  
- Showcase ability to build a full-stack web app  
- Prepare a strong portfolio for IT job applications
